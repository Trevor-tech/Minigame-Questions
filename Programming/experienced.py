# Write a function that takes a sentence as input and reverses the order of words. Output should be returned.
# LOOK AT ORANGE TEXT FIRST.
'''print(reverse_words("hello world"))  # Output: "world hello"
print(reverse_words("Python is fun"))  # Output: "fun is Python"'''

def reverse_words(sentence):
    #return
    pass

# Test Case for you
print(reverse_words("hello world"))  # Output: "world hello"
print(reverse_words("Python is fun"))  # Output: "fun is Python"
